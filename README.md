# twitter-sentiment-analysis
Twitter sentiment analysis app. 

I used two sources to perform the sentiment analysis. I forked the <a href="https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight"> PHPInsight </a> repository to get the sentiments of a given tweet. 
To Pull data from twitter, I used the <a href="https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php"> TwitterAPIExchange </a> library to send GET request for each query.

Currently the app allows users to:-
<ul>
<li> Search for any given tweet </li>
<li> Presents results for top 15 recent tweets for the query  </li>
<li> Presents visual statistics for the 15 tweets based on the sentiment analysis.</li>
</ul>

Following are a few snapshots of the app.
